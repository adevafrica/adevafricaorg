# +A_DevAfrica Security Policy

This document outlines the security practices and incident response procedures for the +A_DevAfrica platform.

## 1. Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within +A_DevAfrica, please report it immediately by contacting [security@adevafrica.com](mailto:security@adevafrica.com). Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

## 2. Security Practices

### 2.1. Authentication and Authorization

*   **Authentication**: We use [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) for robust user authentication, including password hashing and session management. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is encouraged for enhanced security.
*   **Authorization**: [Pundit](https://github.com/varvet/pundit) is used to implement granular authorization policies, ensuring users can only access resources and perform actions they are permitted to.
*   **API Security**: API endpoints are secured using appropriate authentication mechanisms (e.g., token-based authentication) and access controls.

### 2.2. Data Protection

*   **Encryption in Transit**: All communication between clients and our servers is encrypted using TLS/SSL.
*   **Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive data stored in the database is encrypted at rest. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is handled with extreme care, and sensitive fields are encrypted.
*   **Database Security**: We leverage Supabase's robust PostgreSQL security features, including:
    *   **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Implemented to restrict data access at the row level based on user roles and policies. This is crucial for protecting direct client access to data buckets.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege**: Database users and roles are configured with the minimum necessary permissions.

### 2.3. Input Validation and Sanitization

*   All user inputs are rigorously validated and sanitized to prevent common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

### 2.4. Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention

*   We utilize tools like `rack-attack` to implement rate limiting on critical endpoints, mitigating brute-force attacks and denial-of-service (DoS) attempts.
*   Honeypots and other techniques may be employed to detect and deter malicious bots and spam.

### 2.5. Dependency Management

*   We regularly audit and update our third-party dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Tools like `bundler-audit` and `brakeman` are used for static analysis and security scanning.

### 2.6. Secure Coding Practices

*   Our development team adheres to secure coding guidelines, including OWASP Top 10 recommendations.
*   Code reviews are a mandatory part of our development workflow to identify and address potential security flaws.

## 3. Incident Response Plan

In the event of a security incident, we will follow these steps:

1.  **Detection and Identification**: Monitor systems for suspicious activity and identify the scope of the incident.
2.  **Containment**: Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage.
3.  **Eradication**: Remove the root cause of the incident and any malicious artifacts.
4.  **Recovery**: Restore affected systems and data from secure backups.
5.  **Post-Incident Analysis**: Conduct a thorough review to understand what happened, why it happened, and how to prevent similar incidents in the future. This includes updating policies and procedures.
6.  **Communication**: Notify affected users and relevant authorities as required by law and our privacy policy.

## 4. Audits and Reviews

*   Regular security audits and penetration testing are conducted to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
*   Internal security reviews are performed periodically to ensure compliance with our security policies.

This policy will be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect changes in threat landscape and best practices.
