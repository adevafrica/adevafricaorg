### Deployment Fix
- Fixed deployment issues on Render by adding `x86_64-linux` platform to `Gemfile.lock` and ensuring Ruby 3.2.2 and its dependencies are correctly installed.

### Missing boot.rb Fix
- Added `config/boot.rb` to resolve `LoadError` during Rake tasks.



### ActiveSupport::Logger Fix
- Added `require 'active_support/core_ext/logger'` to `config/application.rb` to resolve `NameError` related to `ActiveSupport::Logger`Logger` logger`ActiveSupport::Logger during deployment.



### Deployment Configuration Fixes (2025-08-30)
- **Fixed render.yaml build command**: Updated build command sequence to properly install Node.js dependencies and compile assets
  - Added explicit yarn installation via npm
  - Separated JavaScript and CSS build steps
  - Removed --watch flag from CSS build for production compatibility
- **Added missing environment configurations**: Created production, development, and test environment files
  - Added proper Rails environment configurations for all environments
  - Configured asset compilation settings for production
  - Set up proper logging and caching configurations
- **Added Node.js version specification**: Created .node-version file specifying Node.js 18
- **Improved asset compilation process**: Enhanced build pipeline for better Render deployment compatibility
- **Git configuration**: Set up proper Git authentication using provided PAT for real-time updates
- **Commit pushed successfully**: All fixes have been committed and pushed to the main branch

### Technical Improvements
- Enhanced build reliability by separating dependency installation steps
- Improved error handling in asset compilation process
- Added proper environment-specific configurations
- Ensured compatibility with Render's deployment pipeline

### Files Modified
- `render.yaml`: Updated build command with improved sequence
- `package.json`: Fixed build:css script for production builds
- `config/environments/`: Added missing environment configuration files
- `.node-version`: Added Node.js version specification



### ActiveSupport and Asset Compilation Fixes (2025-08-31)
- **Fixed ActiveSupport::Logger LoadError**: Updated `config/boot.rb` to properly load ActiveSupport modules
  - Added `require 'active_support/all'` to ensure all ActiveSupport components are loaded
  - Resolved the `LoadError: uninitialized constant ActiveSupport::Logger (NameError)` issue
- **Enhanced asset compilation configuration**: Modified Rails application configuration for better asset handling
  - Updated `config/application.rb` with proper asset compilation settings
  - Set `config.assets.compile = true` for production environment
  - Added `config.serve_static_assets = true` for static file serving
- **Created missing asset files**: Added essential JavaScript and CSS application files
  - Created `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` with Hotwire imports
  - Created `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css` with basic styling
  - Added `config/initializers/assets.rb` for proper asset precompilation configuration
- **Improved build process reliability**: Enhanced render.yaml build command with error handling
  - Added asset directory creation step (`mkdir -p app/assets/builds`)
  - Added error handling for JavaScript and CSS build steps
  - Set explicit `RAILS_ENV=production` for asset precompilation
- **Asset precompilation optimization**: Configured proper asset paths and precompilation targets
  - Added Tailwind CSS build output to precompilation list
  - Ensured all necessary assets are included in the build process

### Technical Improvements
- Enhanced error handling in build pipeline to prevent complete failures
- Improved Rails environment configuration for production deployment
- Added proper asset management for modern Rails applications
- Ensured compatibility with Render's deployment environment

### Files Modified
- `config/boot.rb`: Added ActiveSupport loading
- `config/application.rb`: Enhanced asset configuration
- `config/environments/production.rb`: Enabled asset compilation
- `config/initializers/assets.rb`: Added asset precompilation configuration
- `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`: Created JavaScript entry point
- `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`: Created CSS entry point
- `render.yaml`: Improved build command with error handling



## 2025-09-02

- Updated Node.js version to 22.x in `.node-version`.
- Updated Ruby version to 3.3.0 and Rails to 7.1.0 in `Gemfile` and `.ruby-version`.
- Installed missing Tailwind CSS plugins (`@tailwindcss/forms`, `@tailwindcss/typography`, `@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio`).
- Fixed `@apply` usage with `group` utility in `app/assets/stylesheets/application.tailwind.css`.
- Updated `render.yaml` to use `npx tailwindcss` directly for CSS build.
- Updated browserslist database.




## 2025-09-03

### Asset Compilation Configuration Fix
- **Resolved asset compilation conflict**: Fixed inconsistent `config.assets.compile` settings between `application.rb` and `production.rb`
  - Set `config.assets.compile = false` in `config/environments/production.rb` to match `application.rb`
  - Ensures consistent asset handling across all environments
  - Prevents Rails.logger NoMethodError during asset precompilation on Render
- **Deployment optimization**: Aligned production environment configuration with Rails best practices
  - Production environments should use precompiled assets (`config.assets.compile = false`)
  - Improves performance by preventing runtime asset compilation
  - Reduces deployment errors related to asset pipeline initialization

### Technical Analysis
- Analyzed existing deployment logs and error reports from Render platform
- Identified that previous fixes for ActiveSupport::Logger were already implemented
- Found and resolved the remaining configuration conflict causing deployment failures
- Verified all other deployment fixes (boot.rb, render.yaml, package.json) were properly applied

### Files Modified
- `config/environments/production.rb`: Updated asset compilation setting

### Deployment Status
- Changes committed and pushed to main branch as RedwoodsKenyan
- Ready for Render deployment with resolved asset compilation issues
